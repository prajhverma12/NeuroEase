## Project Description

NeuroEase is a comprehensive web application and Chrome extension designed to improve digital accessibility for neurodivergent individuals, including those with autism, dyslexia, and Touretteâ€™s syndrome. It addresses challenges in reading comprehension, information processing, and communication by integrating key assistive technologies:

* **Text Summarization:** Condenses long-form content into concise, easy-to-read summaries, reducing cognitive overload.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts written text into spoken words, aiding individuals with reading impairments like dyslexia.
* **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Transcribes spoken words into written text, facilitating communication for those with verbal difficulties.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Interprets the emotional tone of text, assisting in understanding social and professional interactions.

This project aims to create a more inclusive digital environment, empowering neurodivergent users to interact with online content effectively and confidently.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login.
* **Mental Health Assessments:** Integrated tests to identify and manage mental health concerns.
* **Text Summarization (Chrome Extension/Web):** Summarize web pages and text.
* **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Listen to text read aloud.
* **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Convert speech to text.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze the emotional tone of text.
* **Database Storage:** Stores user data and test results securely.
* **Responsive Design:** Accessible across various devices.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* **Chrome Extension:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** For Summarization and Sentiment analysis.
